# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Tech Stack

### 📱 Frontend

- **React Native** – Cross-platform mobile development (iOS & Android)
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for safer and more scalable code
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling framework for fast and consistent UI design

### 🗄️ Backend & Infrastructure

- **SQL Database** – Structured data storage for users, app content, and analytics
- **Cloudflare** – Edge computing, serverless functions, API routing, security, and global performance optimization

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- React Native handles the mobile interface.
- TypeScript ensures type safety across the codebase.
- Tailwind provides consistent and maintainable styling.
- SQL stores structured application data.
- Cloudflare powers serverless backend logic, API endpoints, authentication, and global content delivery.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

   ```

4. Start the server with the /server directory

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
